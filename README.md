# Material for UCL Neuropixels Course 2024

This repository contains resources and assignments for the UCL Neuropixels Course 2024.

## Course Preparation
Prior to the course we recommend that you work through the installation and data download sections to ensure you have all the necessary software installed and have access to the data that 
will be used during the assignments:
- [Link to installation instructions for the IBL-related content](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/neuropixels_course_2024/tree/main/installation)
- [Link to data download instructions for the IBL-related content](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/neuropixels_course_2024/tree/main/data_access)
- [Link to preparation instructions for UnitMatch](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/neuropixels_course_2024/tree/main/UnitMatch#prerequisites)
- Link to installation instructions for [Bombcell](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell). For now, bombcell is in MATLAB-only, but a Python version is coming in the next month. If you need a MATLAB license, see the details on slack or message us: [julie.mfabre@gmail.com](mailto:julie.mfabre@gmail.com)
- Link to installation instructions for [phy](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-instructions)
